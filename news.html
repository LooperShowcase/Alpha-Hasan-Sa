    <h1>Nike’s growing family of Zoom Vomero 5 colorways welcomes its newest member, combining the drab dad-shoe aesthetic with a much-needed pop of color.

        Relying on the neutral Photon Dust shade on the overlay, the Swoosh adds black accents on the TPU cage and the heel armor, with the Swoosh and tongue logos continuing the matching effort. Then, the mesh base gets flooded in Laser Orange and University Gold for that sunny pop of color, adding a refreshing update to the once long-distance running silhouette.
        
        It’s been quite a spirited run for the Zoom Vomero 5, but are we reaching the point of exhaustion? Although the 2000s-era tech runner aesthetic continues to push forward, Nike has to diversify the portfolio a bit to provide more options at various pricepoints.  If you’re still part of the Vomero 5 gang, plan for Nike to deploy these at retailers online and in-store this Summer 2024 season for $160.Nike’s growing family of Zoom Vomero 5 colorways welcomes its newest member, combining the drab dad-shoe aesthetic with a much-needed pop of color.
